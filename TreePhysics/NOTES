The biggest optimization for doing highly detailed trees is by analogy to tesselation;

Let each RigidBody have a set (16) of turtle instructions: 16 bytes
If we need any constants (step size, etc.), store 8 halfs => 32 bytes

For each updatCompositeBodies step (which is leaf to root order) replay the turtle commands (in reverse order in this step -- is that possible?) accumulating the force, torque, etc.

Calculate the joint angles immediately -- there's no avoiding this, unfortunately.
