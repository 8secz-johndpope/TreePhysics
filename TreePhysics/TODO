- make it so it's easy to switch between updating the joint as its own kernel and have it be embedded in update composite bodies
- generic physics fields


1. Create a simple test: 1 rigid body pointing directly up; torque at 90 degrees
compare eigen vs direct method, see why they differ;

once that's done, evaluate the differential code with two bodies; confirm torque is greater on the taller one
